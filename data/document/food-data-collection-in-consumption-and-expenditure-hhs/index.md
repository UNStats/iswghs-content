title: "Food data collection in household consumption and expenditure surveys: Guidelines for low-and middle-income countries"
description: The Guidelines are intended to be a reference document for National Statistical Offices, survey practitioners, and national and international agencies designing household surveys that involve the collection of food consumption and expenditure data.  The recommendations in these guidelines are intended to assist practitioners in improving survey design, while taking into account the cost of organizing a survey and the constraints statistical offices in low- and middle-income countries face. The guidelines were put together by a team led by FAO and the World Bank, with inputs from representatives of national statistical offices, international organizations, survey practitioners, academics, and experts in different disciplines.

## Background

In December 2017 a draft of the guidelines was circulated to 148 National Statistical Offices from low- to high-income countries for comments. Following this global consultation, the document was revised and [submitted to UNSC](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/BG-Item3j-Guidelines-Food-Consumption-E.pdf), which endorsed it at its forty-ninth session in March 2018. The process received support from the [Global Strategy for Agricultural and Rural Statistics](http://www.gsars.org/).
