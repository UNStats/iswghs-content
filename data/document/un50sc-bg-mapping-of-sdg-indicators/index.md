title: "Intersecretariat Working Group on Household Surveys : Mapping of SDG Indicators"
description: Mapping of the range of global Sustainable Development Goal indicators for which data can be derived from household surveys, based on information on current or proposed use of household surveys for SDG monitoring. A preliminary analysis shows that a total of 77 of the SDG indicators can be sourced (either currently or on the basis of a proposal) from household surveys. This is spread widely across topics (13 of the 17 Goals are involved) but with the greatest concentration in the areas of health, education, gender equality, poverty, hunger, labour and justice. The mapping exercise is described in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Report of the Intersecretariat Working Group on Household Surveys to the 49th Session of the UN Statistical Commission (doc CN.3/2018/7), and was presented as a background document at the 50th Session of the United Nations Statistical Commission.
