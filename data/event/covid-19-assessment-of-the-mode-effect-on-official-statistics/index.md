title: "COVID-19: Assessment of the mode effect on official statistics"
description: As many countries have switched the survey mode from face-to-face to telephone due to the pandemic and are now gradually resuming face-to-face interviewing following the opening up of economies, this webinar aims to delve deeper into assessing the impact of data collection mode on official statistics and the current methodologies NSOs are using to distinguish the mode effect from the pandemic effect. The webinar will also discuss how the experiences gained by countries during the pandemic provide an opportunity for household surveys to move towards a \"new normal\"; and the challenges associated with such transition.  This event is jointly organized by ISWGHS and ECLAC.
