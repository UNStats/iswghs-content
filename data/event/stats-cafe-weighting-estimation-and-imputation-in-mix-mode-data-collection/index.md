title: "Stats Caf√©: Weighting, estimation and imputation in mix-mode data collections"
description: With the COVID-19 pandemic significantly changing our world, official statisticians are now urged to apply new approaches to reduce face to face data collections. One approach has been switching to mixed mode surveys, where a combination of modes such as face-to-face, telephone, web based questionnaire, etc. is used to collect data. Although this approach seems promising, there are technical issues that should be considered and technical capacity has not always caught up with demands.
