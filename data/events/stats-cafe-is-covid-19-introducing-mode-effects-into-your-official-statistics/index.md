title: "Asia-Pacific Stats Café: Is COVID-19 introducing mode effects into your official statistics?"
description: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a range of impacts to statistical operations including abruptly stopping face to face data collections. Many National Statistical Office turned to telephone or web interviews to maintain time series continuity and monitor the health and socio-economic impact of the pandemic. Using alternative modes however, raises issues of time series comparability due to possible mode effects. This Café discussed mode effect assessment methodologies, lessons learned during COVID-19 with alternative modes of data collection, the potential of a \"mixed mode\" approach moving forward, and elements to consider for a cost effective data collection mode that produces high quality data.
