name: Collecting information on national household survey programmes and plans for ad-hoc surveys
round: 2
description: As a first step towards better coordination of household surveys, a stocktaking of national and international surveys that are being carried out, either regularly or of ad-hoc nature would be necessary. The Task force is created to define the scope of and make a plan for the survey stocktaking exercise. Once the scope is defined and the plan is tested and approved, the stocktaking exercise will be carried out by ISWGHS as a work stream.
