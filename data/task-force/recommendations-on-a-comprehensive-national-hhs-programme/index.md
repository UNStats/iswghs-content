name: Developing recommendations on a comprehensive national household survey programme
round: 2
description: Household surveys play an important role in meeting national data needs. A mapping exercise recently conducted shows that around one-third of all SDG indicators (80 out of 232 indicators), covering 13 different goals, can be sourced from household surveys. Despite their crucial role in national statistical systems over the past decades, household surveys are still facing challenges in many countries. Among the identified challenges, two were particularly related to coordination - lack of coordination of international support and unpredictable funding of a short-lived and ad-hoc nature.
